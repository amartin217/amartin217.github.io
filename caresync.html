    <h2>CareSync</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently developing a Flutter mobile application called CareSync, designed to support caregiver groups by helping them coordinate and manage patient care. The app enables caregivers to collaboratively set and track appointments, medications, and vital signs, improving communication and reducing scheduling errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project is still in active development, with the goal of releasing a fully functional version on the app store by December. My work so far has involved building the core application logic in Dart, developing the front-end using Flutter, and integrating RESTful APIs to connect the interface with a SQL database for secure data management and synchronization.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also designing a clean, intuitive user interface focused on accessibility for caregivers with varying levels of technical experience. To ensure the app meets real-world needs, I have been conducting user interviews and feedback sessions with caregivers to guide UI and feature design decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon completion, CareSync will provide an all-in-one platform that streamlines communication, scheduling, and health tracking within caregiving teams, helping improve coordination and patient support.
