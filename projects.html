            <p>I developed a Flutter mobile application designed to support caregiver groups by helping them coordinate and manage patient care. The app enables caregivers to collaboratively set and track appointments, medications, and vital signs, ensuring consistent communication and reducing scheduling errors.</p>

            <p>
             On the technical side, I worked across the full development stack. I designed and implemented the SQL database schema to store and manage user data, appointment information, and health metrics efficiently. Using Dart and the Flutter framework, I built both the front-end interface and the core application logic, integrating the database through RESTful APIs to provide seamless data synchronization. I also implemented input validation and local caching to improve performance and reliability in low-connectivity environments.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              For the user interface, I designed an intuitive layout focused on accessibility and ease of use for caregivers with varying levels of technical experience. I created responsive UI components that made it simple to view schedules, manage medications, and log vitals from any device.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In addition to development, I conducted user interviews and feedback sessions with caregivers to better understand their workflows, pain points, and feature needs. Insights from these sessions directly informed the app’s interface design and feature prioritization, ensuring that the final product addressed real-world caregiving challenges.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Overall, the project combined database design, Flutter development, UI/UX design, and user research to create a reliable, user-centered tool that streamlines communication and coordination among caregiver teams.

            <h3><a href="https://invoice.realtors.org/">Ollion- National Association of Realtors E-Commerce Network</a></h3>
            <p>During my internship at Ollion, I worked as a full-stack developer on the National Association of Realtors’ E-Commerce Network Web Application, a platform used to process and manage electronic funds transfers between real estate organizations. My main focus was modernizing several core pages that had previously relied on a legacy system built in 2003. I included an image of one of these pages above.</p>

<p>On the backend, I built and maintained C# (.NET) APIs to retrieve, validate, and deliver financial data to the front end. I optimized data flow between the server and client, ensuring efficient communication and accurate reporting. I also worked with SQL queries to integrate with databases, supporting new business logic and streamlining data retrieval for reporting and transaction processing.</p>

<p>On the frontend, I developed responsive JavaScript-based interfaces interfaces using the Nuxt and Vue.js frameworks. I implemented dynamic components that displayed live data from the backend, allowing users to easily create, review, and approve electronic funds transfers. These updates significantly improved user experience by reducing load times, simplifying workflows, and enhancing accessibility across devices.</p>

<p>I collaborated with QA and DevOps teams to test and debug the updated features, ensuring stability across environments. The new pages were deployed shortly after I finished the internship, and enhanced workflow efficiency, reduced reporting errors, and provided a smoother, more intuitive experience for users.</p>

<p>Overall, my work spanned the full stack—from API development and integration to frontend implementation—helping transition NAR from an outdated legacy system to a modern, maintainable platform.</p>
