            <p>
  I am currently developing a Flutter mobile application called CareSync, designed to support caregiver groups by helping them coordinate and manage patient care. The app enables caregivers to collaboratively set and track appointments, medications, and vital signs, improving communication and reducing scheduling errors.
</p>

<p>
  The project is still in active development, with the goal of releasing a fully functional version on the app store by December. My work so far has involved building the core application logic in Dart, developing the front-end using Flutter, and integrating RESTful APIs to connect the interface with a SQL database for secure data management and synchronization.
</p>

<p>
  I am also designing a clean, intuitive user interface focused on accessibility for caregivers with varying levels of technical experience. To ensure the app meets real-world needs, I have been conducting user interviews and feedback sessions with caregivers to guide UI and feature design decisions.
</p>

<p>
  Upon completion, CareSync will provide an all-in-one platform that streamlines communication, scheduling, and health tracking within caregiving teams, helping improve coordination and patient support.

            <h3><a href="https://www.schwab.com/trading/thinkorswim/desktop">Charles Schwab- Thinkorswim</a></h3>
            <p>
  During my internship at Charles Schwab, I contributed to the back-end development of a middleware application that supports the Thinkorswim trading platform, a high-performance system used by hundreds of thousands of active traders daily. The application serves as a critical layer between client-facing services and real-time market data, enabling seamless and low-latency communication across distributed systems.
</p>

<p>
  My primary focus was on developing WebSocket APIs using Java, Spring Boot, and Gradle to facilitate real-time data exchange for trading operations. I implemented asynchronous event handling and message routing to support continuous, high-throughput data streams. These APIs were extensively tested and validated within Google Cloud Platform (GCP) QA environments prior to production deployment, ensuring reliability, scalability, and fault tolerance under heavy load.
</p>

<p>
  I also wrote comprehensive unit and integration tests to maintain system robustness, collaborating closely with QA engineers to validate functionality across both development and staging environments. This process included debugging complex multi-threaded interactions and verifying message persistence and delivery guarantees.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond development, I leveraged Git, Bitbucket, and Jira for version control, code reviews, and agile Kanban workflow management. I regularly participated in sprint planning and peer review sessions to maintain code quality and ensure alignment with architectural standards.
</p>

<p>
  Through this work, I delivered production-ready code that contributed directly to real-time data services supporting over 300,000 concurrent users daily. The experience deepened my expertise in distributed systems, concurrent programming, and scalable API design, while giving me hands-on exposure to enterprise-grade development and deployment workflows in a high-stakes trading environment.

            <h3><a href="https://invoice.realtors.org/">Ollion- National Association of Realtors E-Commerce Network</a></h3>
            <p>During my internship at Ollion, I worked as a full-stack developer on the National Association of Realtors’ E-Commerce Network Web Application, a platform used to process and manage electronic funds transfers between real estate organizations. My main focus was modernizing several core pages that had previously relied on a legacy system built in 2003. I included an image of one of these pages above.</p>

<p>On the backend, I built and maintained C# (.NET) APIs to retrieve, validate, and deliver financial data to the front end. I optimized data flow between the server and client, ensuring efficient communication and accurate reporting. I also worked with SQL queries to integrate with databases, supporting new business logic and streamlining data retrieval for reporting and transaction processing.</p>

<p>On the frontend, I developed responsive JavaScript-based interfaces interfaces using the Nuxt and Vue.js frameworks. I implemented dynamic components that displayed live data from the backend, allowing users to easily create, review, and approve electronic funds transfers. These updates significantly improved user experience by reducing load times, simplifying workflows, and enhancing accessibility across devices.</p>

<p>I collaborated with QA and DevOps teams to test and debug the updated features, ensuring stability across environments. The new pages were deployed shortly after I finished the internship, and enhanced workflow efficiency, reduced reporting errors, and provided a smoother, more intuitive experience for users.</p>

<p>Overall, my work spanned the full stack—from API development and integration to frontend implementation—helping transition NAR from an outdated legacy system to a modern, maintainable platform.</p>
