    <h2>Thinkorswim</h2>
    <p> During my internship at Charles Schwab, I contributed to the back-end development of a middleware application that supports the Thinkorswim trading platform, a high-performance system used by hundreds of thousands of active traders daily. The application serves as a critical layer between client-facing services and real-time market data, enabling seamless and low-latency communication across distributed systems. </p>
    
    <p> My primary focus was on developing WebSocket APIs using Java, Spring Boot, and Gradle to facilitate real-time data exchange for trading operations. I implemented asynchronous event handling and message routing to support continuous, high-throughput data streams. These APIs were extensively tested and validated within Google Cloud Platform (GCP) QA environments prior to production deployment, ensuring reliability, scalability, and fault tolerance under heavy load. </p> <p> I also wrote comprehensive unit and integration tests to maintain system robustness, collaborating closely with QA engineers to validate functionality across both development and staging environments. This process included debugging complex multi-threaded interactions and verifying message persistence and delivery guarantees. </p>
    
    <p> Beyond development, I leveraged Git, Bitbucket, and Jira for version control, code reviews, and agile Kanban workflow management. I regularly participated in sprint planning and peer review sessions to maintain code quality and ensure alignment with architectural standards. </p> 
    
    <p> Through this work, I delivered production-ready code that contributed directly to real-time data services supporting over 300,000 concurrent users daily. The experience deepened my expertise in distributed systems, concurrent programming, and scalable API design, while giving me hands-on exposure to enterprise-grade development and deployment workflows in a high-stakes trading environment. </p>
