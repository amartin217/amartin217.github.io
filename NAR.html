    <h2>National Association of Realtors E-Commerce Network</h2>
    <p>During my internship at Ollion, I worked as a full-stack developer on the National Association of Realtors’ E-Commerce Network Web Application, a platform used to process and manage electronic funds transfers between real estate organizations. My main focus was modernizing several core pages that had previously relied on a legacy system built in 2003. I included an image of one of these pages above.</p> 
    
    <p>On the backend, I built and maintained <Strong>C# (.NET) APIs</Strong> to retrieve, validate, and deliver financial data to the front end. I optimized data flow between the server and client, ensuring efficient communication and accurate reporting. I also worked with <Strong>SQL</Strong> queries to integrate with databases, supporting new business logic and streamlining data retrieval for reporting and transaction processing.</p> 
    
    <p>On the frontend, I developed responsive <Strong>JavaScript</Strong>-based interfaces interfaces using the <Strong>Nuxt</Strong> and <Strong>Vue.js</Strong> frameworks. I implemented dynamic components that displayed live data from the backend, allowing users to easily create, review, and approve electronic funds transfers. These updates significantly improved user experience by reducing load times, simplifying workflows, and enhancing accessibility across devices.</p>
    
    <p>I collaborated with QA and DevOps teams to test and debug the updated features, ensuring stability across environments. The new pages were deployed shortly after I finished the internship, and enhanced workflow efficiency, reduced reporting errors, and provided a smoother, more intuitive experience for users.</p> 
    
    <p>Overall, my work spanned the full stack—from API development and integration to frontend implementation—helping transition NAR from an outdated legacy system to a modern, maintainable platform.</p>
