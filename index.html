        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I’m Allison Martin, a Computer Science Engineering student at the University of Michigan’s College of Engineering. 
        I’m passionate about back-end development—designing efficient systems, working with databases, and building scalable APIs that power intuitive front-end experiences. </p>
        <p>I’m especially interested in fintech because it blends technology and problem-solving to make financial systems more accessible, secure, and impactful. 
        During my internship at Charles Schwab, I worked on software that supported the Thinkorswim trading platform, which strengthened my interest in the infrastructure behind modern finance. </p>
        <p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, playing tennis, and staying active through exercise. 
        I’m always eager to learn new technologies and contribute to projects that make a real-world difference.</p>
